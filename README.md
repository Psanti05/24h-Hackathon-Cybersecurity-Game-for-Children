October 2024

I participated with 3 of my friends to a 24h Hackathon for the Major League Hacking (MLH) Newhacks 2024 Hackathon.
In this event, each team builds a project from scratch. Afterwards, we needed to present our project to a panel of industry judges to compete for prizes. 
This year's themes were Video Games, Cybersecurity, and Tech for Natural Disasters!
With only 24h, our team rapidly learned C# on Unity to build an educational video game teaching children about cybersecurity awareness and safe technology use.
This meant that we would fit in 2 of the 3 offered categories, which we believed would be an innovative idea to present to the juries.

Unfortunately, I was not the creator of the Unity project so I do not have direct to it. However, I have uploaded the available files for the game's code in this repository.
Hoping you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed this amazing opportunity!

Thanks to Newhacks again
